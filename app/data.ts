    YOJANA - Umbrella Scheme
    1) - KHADI VIKAS YOJANA 
    Modified Market Development Assistance 
    (MMDA) Scheme(A) - 
    Initially, the Government of India introduced the scheme of Market 
    Development Assistance (MDA) on production in place of rebate, 
    after experimenting with several pilot schemes. The scheme has 
    been given effect from 1st April, 2010 to help Khadi Institutions to 
    reorient their activities extending adequate emphasis towards 
    increasing artisans' earnings as well as ensuring quality of Khadi to 
    customers. The scheme of MDA on Production aims at uniform 
    distribution of sales throughout the year unlike the erstwhile rebate 
    scheme where most of the sale took place during the special rebate 
    season of 108 days. A well-dispersed sale spread over the year is 
    helping Khadi Institutions to keep inventory levels down, thereby 
    offering greater scope for mobilization of required working capital.
    Further, the Govt. of India has introduced the Modified Market 
    Development Assistance (MMDA) scheme w.e.f., 3rd Quarter of 
    2016-17 under which 30% is provided as grant on Prime Cost of 
    Khadi&Polyvastra. MMDA Scheme aims at decontrolling and 
    de-linking the sales price from the Cost Chart thus offering scope to 
    the Institutions to add value to Khadi; so that the products can be 
    sold at market oriented prices. 
    The MMDA is calculated @ 30% on Prime Cost of Khadi&Polyvastra 
    includes cost of raw material plus conversion charges upto grey 
    cloth plus processing charges without margins, as specified in the 
    Cost Chart. Khadi Institutions undertaking production as well as 
    sales activity shall be entitled for 60% of MMDA (40% for production 
    and 20% for sales), the remaining 30% shall be distributed to 
    Spinners & Weavers and 10% to Karyakartas / other Artisans.
